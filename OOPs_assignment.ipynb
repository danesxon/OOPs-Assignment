        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " > Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code using objects instead of just functions and logic. An object is like a real-world entity (e.g., a car, a phone, or a bank account) that has properties (attributes) and actions (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        " > Key Concepts of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Class – A blueprint/template for creating objects (e.g., \"Car\" is a class).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Object – An instance of a class (e.g., \"MyCar\" is an object of the \"Car\" class).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Encapsulation – Hiding details of an object and only exposing necessary parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Inheritance – A class can inherit properties and methods from another class (e.g., \"ElectricCar\" inherits from \"Car\").\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Polymorphism – One function can have multiple forms (e.g., \"drive()\" works differently for a car and a bike).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Abstraction – Hiding complex details and showing only necessary features (e.g., using a \"TurnOn()\" function without knowing the internal wiring).\n",

        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        " > Abstraction is about hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, when you drive a car, you only use the steering wheel and pedals without worrying about the internal mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods together while restricting direct access to certain details. It helps in data protection by allowing access only through defined methods. For example, a car’s engine is hidden inside the bonnet, and you can only start it using the ignition key rather than directly interacting with the engine components.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " > Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__). They are also called magic methods because they allow customization of how objects behave.\n",
        "\n",
        " > Common Dunder Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "> __init__(self, ...) → Constructor, initializes an object\n",
        "\n",
        "> __str__(self) → Returns a string representation of the object\n",
        "\n",
        "> __len__(self) → Defines behavior for len()\n",
        "\n",
        "> __add__(self, other) → Defines behavior for + operator\n",
        "\n",
        "> __getitem__(self, key) → Enables indexing (obj[key])\n",
        "\n",
        "> Dunder methods let you define how objects behave with built-in Python functions and operators, making your classes more intuitive and Pythonic.\n",

        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        " > Definition: Inheritance is a feature of OOP that allows one class (child class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class (parent class).\n",
        "\n",
        " > Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Reusability: Child class can use existing code from the parent class, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Hierarchy: It establishes a relationship between classes (parent → child).\n",
        "\n",
        "> Extensibility: Child class can add new features or override parent class methods.\n",
        "\n",

        "    Here, Dog inherits from Animal, but overrides the speak method.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Types of Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Single Inheritance – One child class inherits from one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Multiple Inheritance – A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Multilevel Inheritance – A class inherits from another child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple child classes inherit from one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Hybrid Inheritance – Combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n",

        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " > A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects when a class is created. It is defined using the __init__() method and is automatically called when an object is instantiated.\n",

        "\n",
        " > Class Method (@classmethod)\n",
        "\n",
        "It belongs to the class, not instances (objects).\n",
        "It can access and modify class variables.\n",
        "Defined using @classmethod decorator.\n",

        "\n",
        "> It does not depend on class or instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Used for utility/helper functions inside the class.\n",

        "\n",
        "    print(Math.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        " >Key Difference:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Class Method: Works with class attributes (cls).\n",
        "\n",
        "> Static Method: Independent utility function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  >  Method Overloading in Python\n",
        "Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python does not support method overloading directly like other languages (e.g., Java, C++). Instead, Python handles it using default arguments and *args or **kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          class MathOperations:\n",
        "          def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):  # Default values allow overloading behavior\n",
        "          return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        "          obj = MathOperations()\n",
        "          print(obj.add(5))       # Output: 5\n",
        "          print(obj.add(5, 10))   # Output: 15\n",
        "          print(obj.add(5, 10, 15)) # Output: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "    Here, the add method works with different numbers of arguments, mimicking overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " > Definition:\n",
        "Method Overriding is a feature in OOP where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the child class must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the parent class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Happens in inheritance (between parent and child class).\n",
        "\n",
        "> The child class method replaces the parent class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Used to achieve runtime polymorphism (dynamic method dispatch).\n",
        "\n",
        "> The super keyword can be used to call the parent class method.\n",
        "Example (Python):\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Parent:\n",
        "        def show(self):\n",

        "        def show(self):  # Overriding the parent method\n",
        "            print(\"This is the child class method.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    obj = Child()\n",
        "    obj.show()  # Output: This is the child class method.\n",
        " >Why Use It?\n",
        "\n",
        " >To provide a specific implementation in the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        " >To customize behavior without modifying the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " > A property decorator in Python (@property) is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods in a class while keeping the syntax simple and readable. It allows you to access a method like an attribute without using parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Person:\n",

        "        p.name = \"Alice\"  # Modifying using setter\n",
        "        del p.name  # Deleting the attribute\n",
        "\n",
        " > Why use @property?\n",
        "\n",
        "> Encapsulates data like a private variable but allows controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Improves code readability by making method calls look like attribute access.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Helps in implementing validation and logic when setting values.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " > Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Why is it important?\n",
        "\n",
        "> Code Reusability – Write a single function/method that works for different data types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Flexibility & Extensibility – Easily extend or modify code without affecting existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        ">Readability & Maintainability – Simplifies complex code, making it easier to understand and update.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Method Overriding – A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Dynamic Method Binding – At runtime, the program decides which method to execute based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "> If a parent class Animal has a method makeSound(), different child classes like Dog and Cat can override it to produce different sounds (bark() or meow()).\n",
        "\n",
        "> This way, a single function call works for multiple object types, making programming more efficient!\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " > An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated (you can't create objects from it) and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes. It can have abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be defined in child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Key Points:\n",
        ">Defined using the ABC module (from abc import ABC, abstractmethod).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "> Reusability – You can reuse existing code (through inheritance), saving time and effort.\n",
